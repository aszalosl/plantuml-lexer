# plantuml-lexer
Lexer for the vis editor

In order to take advantage of the features of the [Vis insert completion](https://github.com/jpaulogg/vis-ins-completion) plugin, it is worth using a lexical analyzer for the current programming language. These are already provided for more than a hundred languages, but I am missing the right one for my diagram-creator [plantUML](https://plantuml.com). Although its language is [very complicated](https://plantuml.com/guide), to get started, you don't have to enter so many things for the diagrams I often use, that's why I prepared an initial version, which I will expand from time to time, according to my needs.
